Collaborating with GitHub
===

I can't imagine working on my own solo projects without Git and GitHub. I can work from any computer, track all of my work, and experiment without messing up working versions of my code. 

However, the real reason GitHub was created was for programmers to collaborate. "Open source" software, for example, is built by coders who collaborate. This ability for anyone to contribute and improve source code is made possible by platform such as GitHub. 

Nowadays academic research includes a significant programming component. In order to increase productivity -- and to make research open and reproducible -- thousands of academic teams now use version control software like GitHub for collaborating. (For a great overview and guide to best practices in empirical social science, see [Gentzkow and Shapiro][1].)

No one truly codes alone. Coders congregate online to ask for help and share tips. [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/tour), for example, has numerous communities devoted to programming. One of the most popular -- and my personal go-to -- is [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). But if you're looking for help that is *project specific*, [Googling](http://lmgtfy.com/) for help or turning to Stack Overflow often isn't option. Perhaps your problem is specific to your proprietary data or you're getting funny results. Those are problems best left to you and your team to solve -- with the internet as a reference tool.

In this class, we will try to emulate start-ups and top academic researchers by learning to collaborate on projects using GitHub. You will each be part of a team. As a team, you will learn to code together, honing your skills on your group project so you can then do data analysis solo for your individual project.

[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) will be the method each team will learn to simplify and encourage collaboration. As a class, we will follow aspects of the [Agile Development Philosophy ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_principles) by coding in groups and breaking down projects into smaller deliverables.
