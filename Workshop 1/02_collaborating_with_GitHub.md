Collaborating with GitHub
===

I can't imagine working on my own solo projects without Git and GitHub. I can work from any computer, track all of my work, and experiment without messing up working versions of my code. However, the real reason GitHub was created was for programmers to collaborate en masse. ["Open source"](http://opensource.org/) software, for example, is built by community of coders who collaborate to improve the same program. This ability for anyone to contribute and improve source code is not new (e.g. [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/) has been around since 1999), but it has been significantly democratized by platform such as GitHub.

Coding is no longer just for hackers and CS majors. Nowadays most academic research includes a significant programming component. In order to increase productivity --- and to make research open and reproducible --- thousands of academic teams have adopted version control software like GitHub for collaborating. (For a great overview and guide to best practices in empirical social science, see [Gentzkow and Shapiro][1].)

In this class, we will try to emulate start-ups and top academic researchers by learning to collaborate on projects using GitHub. You will each be part of a team. As a team, you will learn to code together, honing your skills on your group project so you can then do data analysis solo for your individual project.

No one truly codes alone. Coders congregate online to ask for help and share tips. [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/tour), for example, has numerous communities devoted to programming. One of the most popular --- and my personal go-to --- is [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). But if you're looking for help that is *project specific*, [Googling](http://lmgtfy.com/) for help or turning to Stack Overflow often isn't option. Perhaps your problem is specific to your proprietary data or you're getting funny results. Those are problems best left to you and your team to solve --- with the internet as a reference tool.

[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) "branch-based" workflow will be the method each team will learn to help facilitate collaboration. As a class (and hopefully within your teams), we will incorporate aspects of the [Agile Development Philosophy ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_principles) by coding in groups and breaking down projects into smaller deliverables that are turned in every two weeks.

Understanding GitHub Flow will require that we learn about *"branching"*. Specifically, we will learn how to manage and use branches by *"checking out"*, *"fetching"*, *"merging"*, and *"pulling"* branches. Since mistakes are inevitable, we will also learn how to *"reset"* a branch.

Let's get started.

- Cat Teams

<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

----

## Cat Teams
1. **Break up into teams.** 
	
	Yes, we know --- it's the first day, it's awkward, and you have no idea if your new teammates will be burdens or all-stars or somewhere in between. Welcome to the real world.

	Each team will be named after a type of cat. Henceforth, your *"Cat Team"*.

2. **Write the name, duke email, and GitHub username of each team member on your Cat Team sheet.**
