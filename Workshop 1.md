 Workshop 1: Git
===
Whether you are working on your own project or on a team project, [version control](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) is essential. It's like using "track changes" in MS Word but cleaner and more dependable. It's also free, works on any operating system, and can track any text-like document -- not just a single MS word document. Most importantly, version control allows you to confidently and fearlessly get work done -- your own or your team's -- while also avoiding file-clutter and file-renaming headaches:

In this class, we will be using a version control system called [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and a popular online hosting service called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a powerful tool for building projects and collaborating with other researchers. To incentivize master of Git, any and all work for this class must be pushed to GitHub to receive credit.

Let's get started.
