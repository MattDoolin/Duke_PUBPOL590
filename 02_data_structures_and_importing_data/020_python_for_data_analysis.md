# Python for Data Analysis

<span style="font-variant:small-caps">[**Python for Data Analysis**](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793)</span> by Wes McKinney (henceforth McKinney or PDA) is a phenomenal book. I've had to teach myself Python and have found his book to be one of the best programming books I've ever read. It is tailored specifically to using Python for doing data analysis but it has fantastic general information about Python. A lot of what I cover in this class will borrow directly from McKinney's fantastic book.

McKinney's book also comes with an accompanying [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-book) that has all of the examples and data used in the book as freely available [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) (more on those later). It is useful as a reference if you ever want to interact with the code from the book yourself.

If you are seriously interested in learning about programming with Python (or learning to program in general), I recommend working through the appendix of **Python for Data Analysis**. I personally worked through the appendix and found it super useful (and fun). My notes and highlights which can also be found on my [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/ultinomics) under the repo [_**pyfordata**_](https://github.com/ultinomics/pyfordata).

Another short and well-written book about general Python programming is **Think Python**. The author, Allen Downey, writes and published many other free texts under his "Think" series, which are all available from his website, [**Green Tea Press**](http://www.greenteapress.com/). 

However, the focus of this class is *data analysis*. Therefore, while it is helpful to learn all the specifics of the Python language, it is not necessary. We will cover enough Python to introduce you to higher level data analysis but not enough to be amateur Python programmers. You are encouraged to learn more about Python on your own but it is not required.

### The Toolkits
We will be using a few toolkits which will allow us to use Python for data analysis: **IPython**, **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**. Canopy installs these toolkits (and loads more) by default. 

The toolkit we will jump straight into using is **pandas**. Pandas is the leading data structures toolkit for Python. If you'd like to learn more about the other toolkits, please McKinney's book.

Let's get started with pandas.
