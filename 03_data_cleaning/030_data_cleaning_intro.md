**Part 2 -** Data Cleaning Intro

---

Anyone who works with data spends a vast majority of their time in data [*pre-processing stage*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_pre-processing). Raw data, much like raw food, must be cleaned before it can be processed (cooked). Raw data will *always* have errors and anomalies that need to be corrected. Finding and correcting these errors (cleaning) is tedious and often soul crushing. And it can take a very, very long time.

To understand just how normal, and important, data cleaning (aka "data janitor work") is, I recommend reading the following [NY Times article](http://nyti.ms/1mZywng) about data cleaning.

In the past, this could be done by hand. With big data, that is impossible. One must write a program or function that automates the cleaning process. And while there are some stock tools that can do a bulk of the most common cleaning, generally no two data sets are alike, which requires that every new data set have a tailor-made cleaning algorithm.

Let's get started with data cleaning.
